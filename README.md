# Arduino programs

## About the author

Back in 2008 I started a Web Design course. In this course I learned things like HTML, CSS, PHP, ASP, Corel Draw, Macromedia Flash, Dreamweaver, Adobe Photoshop, etc.

But the course didn't get so deep in those areas, so I haven't learned a lot, and I also went into another direction. Then after some years I started learning engineering. In the first year I was introduced with C++, and there I could get a better understanding of programming than with my previous Web Design studies.

Some years later, after finishing engineering studies, I decided to get back into programming and I started to learn Arduino. I loved it. It was simple and powerful at the same time. I started watching some Youtube tutorials and soon after I was building real life projects.

Here you will find some Arduino programs that I used to learn this technology and also some projects that I am developing.
